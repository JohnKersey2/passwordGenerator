# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## About

This is a small tool that allows someone to autogenerate a secure, randomized password.

## Task

For this task, I was to modify starter code to create a password generate that allows users to set a few customer options. Using Javascript, I was to query a user for information and then display a randomized set of characters based on their selection.
